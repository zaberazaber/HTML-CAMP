Why we use <!DOCTYPE html>?
Doctype stands for Document Type Declaration. It informs the web browser about the type and version of HTML used in building the web document.

What is a Head Tag?
The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.
